        <h1>Are Aliens Among Us!!!</h1>
       
        <p>The fear that there might be alien enemies in our midst resonates with fears of Soviets and communists from the McCarthy era. 
            Ultimately, in this story,
             the humans are the ones who accost and capture the alien woman. 
             The shift in perspective puts the humans in the position of the monsters.

            <h2><b> History </b></h2>

              <h4>Flying sausers and Project Blue Boook </h4>
 
 
              <p class="p1"  style="color: blanchedalmond;">The first well-known UFO sighting occurred in 1947, when businessman Kenneth Arnold claimed
     to see a group of nine 
 high-speed objects near Mount Rainier in Washington while flying his small plane. Arnold estimated the speed of the crescent-shaped objects
 as several thousand miles per hour and said they moved “like saucers skipping on water.”
 In the newspaper report that followed, it was mistakenly stated that the objects were saucer-shaped, hence the term flying saucer.</p>
                 <br>

 <p  class="p2" style="color: blanchedalmond;">Sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena increased, and in 1948 the<a style="color:greenyellow " href="https://www.airforce.com/"> U.S. Air Force</a>
began an investigation of these reports called 
Project Sign. The initial opinion of those involved with the project was that the UFOs were most likely sophisticated Soviet aircraft, 
although some researchers suggested that they might be spacecraft from other worlds, the so-called extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH).
Within a year, Project Sign was succeeded by Project Grudge, which in 1952 was itself replaced by the longest-lived of the official 
inquiries into UFOs, Project Blue Book, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. From 1952 to 1969 Project
Blue Book
 compiled reports of more than 12,000 sightings or events, each of which was ultimately classified as (1) “identified” with a known 
 astronomical, atmospheric, or artificial (human-caused) phenomenon or (2) “unidentified.” The latter category, approximately 
 6 percent of the total
 , included cases for which there was insufficient information to make an identification with a known phenomenon.</p>

 <h2 style="color: blueviolet; text-align: left;">The Robertson Panel and the Condon Report</h2>
 <p class p3 style="color: azure;">An American obsession with the UFO phenomenon was under way. In the hot summer of 1952 a 
    provocative series of radar and visual sightings occurred near National Airport in Washington, D.C. Although these events were
     attributed to temperature inversions in the air over the city, not everyone was convinced by this explanation. Meanwhile, 
     the number of UFO reports had climbed to a record high. This led the Central Intelligence Agency to prompt the U.S.
      government to establish an expert panel of scientists to investigate the phenomena. The panel was headed by H.P. Robertson, 
      a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, and included other physicists, an astronomer,
       and a rocket engineer. The Robertson Panel met for three days in 1953 and interviewed military officers and the head of Project Blue Book.
        They also reviewed films and photographs of UFOs. Their conclusions were that (1) 90 percent of the sightings could be easily attributed
         to astronomical and meteorologic phenomena (e.g., bright planets and stars, meteors, auroras, ion clouds) or to such earthly objects as 
         aircraft, balloons, birds, and searchlights, (2) there was no obvious security threat, and (3) there was no evidence to support the ETH.
     Parts of the panel’s report were kept classified until 1979, and this long period of secrecy helped fuel suspicions 
     of a government cover-up.</p>

     <br>
     <p class p4 style="color:azure">A second committee was set up in 1966 at the request of the Air Force to review the most interesting
         material gathered by Project Blue Book. Two years later this committee, which made a detailed study of 59 UFO sightings,
          released its results as Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects—also known as the Condon Report, named for Edward U. Condon,
           the physicist who headed the investigation. The Condon Report was reviewed by a special committee of the National Academy
            of Sciences. A total of 37 scientists wrote chapters or parts of chapters for the report, which covered investigations of 
            the 59 UFO sightings in detail. Like the Robertson Panel, the committee concluded that there was no evidence of anything
             other than commonplace phenomena in the reports and that UFOs
         did not warrant further investigation. This, together with a decline in sighting activity, 
         led to the dismantling of Project Blue Book in 1969.</p>
